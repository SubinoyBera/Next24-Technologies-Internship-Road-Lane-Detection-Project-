# Next24-Technologies-Internship-Road-Lane-Detection-Project-
In this project a line detection algorithm is proposed to detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images. Recognizing lane markings on roads is possible using well known computer vision techniques.
